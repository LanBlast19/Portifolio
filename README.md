Hola âœ¨
hope you are doing great.
So basically I have made this portifolio based website for my school project and realised why not post it on GitHub cause I am still getting started with Git and GitHub.
So this CV/Resume/Portifolio(giv eit whatever name you feel like) consists nothing but some of my details and also some of the projects I have done with
the help of a widely known 3D software Blender and web designs using Figma.
I am a upskilling video editor also but web-dev,blender and UI/UX are my forte. Anyways, this portifolio will give you a brief look inside my work and also 
*dont focus on the WORK EXPERIENCE THING cause I am just aspiring to do that stuff, although I have already initiated a cab booking services app that is underway* Apart from that everything is true!
